# Obesity and Demographic Factors Analysis

## Overview

This project delves into a comprehensive analysis of obesity trends and their correlation with demographic factors from 2009 to 2021. The study explores patterns in obesity rates, vegetable consumption, and physical activity levels across various demographic categories, including age groups, genders, education levels, income brackets, and racial/ethnic groups.

## Key Insights

- **Trend Projection:** The project includes a trendline projection for the next three years, suggesting a potential growth of around 2.3% in obesity rates by 2024.
  
- **Gender Analysis:** Examination reveals no correlation in obesity between genders, but subtle differences emerge in leisure-time physical activity and vegetable consumption.

- **Age-Related Patterns:** Age is identified as a significant factor influencing obesity rates, with a peak in the 45–64 age group. Noteworthy is the subsequent decrease among individuals aged 65 and older. Lack of leisure-time physical activity tends to rise gradually with age, and the age group of 18–24 exhibits distinct patterns in low vegetable consumption.

- **Income and Lifestyle:** Individuals with higher income levels exhibit lower obesity rates, higher engagement in leisure-time physical activity, and more frequent vegetable consumption, indicating a potential link between socio-economic status and healthier lifestyle choices.

- **Race/Ethnicity Variation:** Significant variations are observed among different racial/ethnic groups, with the Asian group showing the lowest tendency for obesity and the Non-Hispanic Black group exhibiting the highest.

- **Education Correlation:** A compelling correlation is identified between education level and obesity-related criteria, highlighting that individuals with higher education tend to have lower obesity rates, engage in more physical activity, and consume more vegetables.

## Importance and Implications

Understanding these patterns is crucial for tailoring effective public health interventions and targeted strategies. The project provides valuable insights into the diverse health needs of different demographic groups, paving the way for informed decision-making in public health policy.
